## FAQs ⭐️

### 1. How does this app work?

This app helps you find your device by tracking its signal strength. By moving around incrementally, you can see your device's signal strength increase or decrease. Once its signal strength indicates that you are within reaching distance of it, start looking around for it! 👌

### 2. Why isn't my device listed?

There are several possible reasons for why this app can't detect any signals from your device.

- A device may not emit signals if it's connected or paired to another app or device. 💡 **Make sure your device is disconnected and unpaired.**
- Signals may be obstructed or weakened by large objects. 💡 **Move around walls and large furnitures.**
- Signals may be out of range. 💡 **Walk toward other areas.**
