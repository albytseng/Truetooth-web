# FAQs ⭐️

## 1. How does this app work?

This app helps you find your device by tracking its signal strength.

1. **Walk around your vicinity.** As you do so, you can see your device's signal strength increase or decrease on the display. 2. **Look around for your device.** Once your device's signal strength indicates that you are within reaching distance, start looking in your surroundings for it! 👌

## 2. Why isn't my device listed?

There are several possible reasons for why this app can't detect any signals from your device.

- Your device may not emit signals if:
  - It's connected or paired to another app or device. **Make sure no apps or devices are connected/paired to your device.**
  - It's being charged. **As you look around, also look for your device's charging equipment.**
  - It's powered off.
- Signals may be obstructed or weakened by large objects. **Move around walls and large furniture.**
- Signals may be out of range. **Exlore areas out of your vicinity.**
